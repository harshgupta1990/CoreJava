Rules for overriding:- 
1. Method name same
   Argument type must be same
   Method Signature
   
 2. Return type must be same (from 1.5 ver -> co varient return type -> child return type need not be same as 
 parent return type, its child return types are also allowed)
 
 3. We cann't reduce scope of access modifiers but can increase it in overriding method
 
 4. In static  methods, overriding is not possible 
 
 5. on private and final methods, overriding is not possible
 
 6. synchronised, strictfp -> no effect
